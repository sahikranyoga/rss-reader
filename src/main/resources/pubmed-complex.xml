The intervention group was instructed to learn and practice the modules daily for 12 weeks. At the end of the 4-week RCT, the control group was instructed to learn and practice the modules for the remaining 8 weeks. Primary outcomes included stress and well-being. Secondary outcomes included anxiety, depression, resilience, positive affect and negative affect. Linear mixed-effects models were used for analyses. Isha Upa Yoga significantly reduced stress (Group [intervention, control] Ã— Time [baseline, Week 4] interaction, p = .009, d = .27) and increased well-being (Group Ã— Time interaction p = .002, d = .32). By the study's end, the intervention and control groups experienced significant improvements in well-being (p &lt; .001, p &lt; .001), stress (p &lt; .001, p &lt; .001), anxiety (p &lt; .001, p &lt; .001), depression (p &lt; .001, p = .004), positive affect (p = .04, p &lt; .001), and negative affect (p &lt; .001, p &lt; .001). Online Isha Upa Yoga shows promise for mitigating the pandemic's negative impact on undergraduates' mental health and improving their well-being.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35064741/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">35064741</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1111/aphw.12341>10.1111/aphw.12341</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

In view of a dearth of evidence, the current study explores the challenges faced by CHWs while rendering maternal and child health services. A qualitative study through in-depth interviews (IDI) and focus group discussions (FGD) in six districts of Odisha was conducted from February to April 2021. Data were analyzed using MAXQDA software. Personal-level challenges, like lack of family support, stress, and fear of contracting COVID-19; facility-level challenges, like transportation problems and inadequate personal protective measures; and community-level challenges, like stigma, resistance, and lack of community support were major hindrances in provisioning routine MCH services. Prevailing myths and misconceptions concerning COVID-19 were factors behind stigma and resistance. Sharing experiences with family, practicing yoga and pranayam, engaging ambulance bikes, financial assistance to mothers, counseling people, and involving community leaders were some effective strategies to address these challenges. Development and implementation of appropriate strategy guidelines for addressing the challenges of frontline warriors will improve their work performance and achieve uninterrupted MCH services during pandemics or similar health emergencies.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35052251/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">35052251</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10010088>10.3390/healthcare10010088</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

The COVID-19 pandemic has added a new layer of stress on dental students and although the topic of wellness has been addressed in various ways in dental school environments, integrating a wellness component that supports our student's vulnerabilities while also teaching skills to build resilience to adversity is a needed and missing component in the dental curriculum. Elective stress management wellness courses have been implemented in dental schools and although this is a promising start, the demands of the dental school curriculum make it a difficult environment to become relaxed, grounded, and focused. Based on 6 years of experience in creating and implementing an integrated wellness program at an academic dental institution, this article aims to outline the benefits and applications for teaching mind-body practices in the dental school curriculum as preventative approaches to maintaining overall student wellness, for developing effective strategies to manage academic and clinical challenges and how it sets the foundation for the health, well-being, and professional mindset of future dentists.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35017866/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">35017866</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8691436/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8691436</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.4103/ijoy.ijoy_7_21>10.4103/ijoy.ijoy_7_21</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

Moderate exercise is a significant non-pharmacological strategy, to reduce the infection-related burden of COVID-19, especially in patients who are obese, elderly, and with additional comorbidities. The imbalance of T helper type 1 (Th1) or T helper type 2 (Th2) cells has been well documented among populations who have suffered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and who are at maximum risk of infection and mortality. Moderate and low intensity exercise can benefit persons at risk from the disease and survivors by favorable modulation in Th1/Th2 ratios. Moreover, in COVID-19 patients, mild to moderate intensity aerobic exercise also increases immune system function but high intensity aerobic exercise may have adverse effects on immune responses. In addition, sustained hypoxia in COVID-19 patients has been reported to cause organ failure and cell death. Hypoxic conditions have also been highlighted to be triggered in COVID-19-susceptible individuals and COVID-19 survivors. This suggests that hypoxia inducible factor (HIF 1Î±) might be an important focus for researchers investigating effective strategies to minimize the effects of the pandemic. Intermittent hypoxic preconditioning (IHP) is a method of exposing subjects to short bouts of moderate hypoxia interspersed with brief periods of normal oxygen concentrations (recovery). This methodology inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory factors, activates HIF-1Î± to activate target genes, and subsequently leads to a higher production of red blood cells and hemoglobin. This increases angiogenesis and increases oxygen transport capacity. These factors can help alleviate virus induced cardiopulmonary hemodynamic disorders and endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, during the COVID-19 pandemic we propose that populations should engage in low to moderate exercise individually designed, prescribed and specific, that utilizes IHP including pranayama (yoga), swimming and high-altitude hiking exercise. This would be beneficial in affecting HIF-1Î± to combat the disease and its severity. Therefore, the promotion of certain exercises should be considered by all sections of the population. However, exercise recommendations and prescription for COVID-19 patients should be structured to match individual levels of capability and adaptability.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35003073/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">35003073</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8727446/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8727446</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.761382>10.3389/fimmu.2021.761382</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

The causative agent SARS-CoV-2 is easily subject to repeated mutation with swift spread of infection. The management of COVID-19 has been a big challenge on account of non-availability of specific therapeutic agents. The complex and multifactorial pathophysiology of COVID-19 requires therapeutic agents with anti-viral properties against SARS-CoV-2 as well as immunomodulatory properties that have a broad-spectrum effectiveness covering the disease in totality. AYUSH-64, a poly-herbal formulation developed by CCRAS, Ministry of AYUSH, Govt. of India through extensive pharmacological, toxicological and clinical studies has proven efficacy in infective febrile conditions such as malaria, micro filaremia, chikungunya and influenza with no safety issues observed in published clinical studies. Based on the empirical evidence, it has been repurposed as an adjuvant to standard care or standalone therapy for asymptomatic and mild to moderate cases of COVID- 19 by the Ministry of AYUSH at a time when India is experiencing wave after wave of COVID-19 variants causing mass distress to the healthcare delivery systems. AYUSH- 64 has four ingredients having immune-modulator, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, antioxidant and anti-viral activities. These effects could arrest the extreme inflammatory responses in COVID-19 that causes progression to significant morbidity. Several clinical studies on AYUSH-64 in asymptomatic and mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 have been undertaken at reputed medical institutions across the country. The evidence generated through these studies is promising. AYUSH-64 has also been incorporated in the National COVID management protocol based on Ayurveda and Yoga by Government of India for asymptomatic and mild cases of COVID-19. Further, on the basis of tangible evidence generated through robust clinical and experimental studies on AYUSH-64, the Ministry of AYUSH has launched nation-wide campaign for mass distribution of <i>AYUSH-64</i> to asymptomatic, mild to moderate COVID-19 patients in home isolation to reduce the burden on the hospital-based health care delivery system. This review will highlight about the specifications of AYUSH-64, its probable mechanism of action, its repurposing for COVID-19, various clinical and experimental studies undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic and the initiatives taken to translate the outcomes of these studies on AYUSH-64<b>.</b></p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002178/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">35002178</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8723836/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8723836</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2021.100538>10.1016/j.jaim.2021.100538</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

The vast majority of antigen tests detect nucleocapsid (N) protein, a structural protein that displays less variation than the spike (S) protein across different SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Although antigen tests are less sensitive than RT-PCR tests, their ability to quickly detect individuals with high viral loads provides clinical and public health utility in many countries, including Australia, where antigen tests have recently been approved for self-testing (2). As new variants arise, including the recent emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant, it is essential to rapidly assess the performance of diagnostic assays. Here, in order to assess and compare the ability of antigen tests to detect delta and omicron variants, we performed a rapid assessment of ten commercially available antigen tests.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34936477/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">34936477</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.02479-21>10.1128/jcm.02479-21</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

We found the response to oxidative stress, detoxification, and cell cycle regulation pathways were down-regulated after meditation. Strikingly, 220 genes directly associated with immune response, including 68 genes related to interferon signaling, were up-regulated, with no significant expression changes in the inflammatory genes. This robust meditation-specific immune response network is significantly dysregulated in multiple sclerosis and severe COVID-19 patients. The work provides a foundation for understanding the effect of meditation and suggests that meditation as a behavioral intervention can voluntarily and nonpharmacologically improve the immune response for treating various conditions associated with excessive or persistent inflammation with a dampened immune system profile.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34907015/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">34907015</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8713789/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8713789</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2110455118>10.1073/pnas.2110455118</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened medical student well-being and sense of community. VWLC programming may be an effective strategy for promoting medical student wellness and community while social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. To our knowledge, this is the first virtual wellness program for promotion of medical student mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic to be described in the literature.</description>

Because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, our medical school transitioned to an all-virtual learning environment from March to June 2020, which raised concerns among student leaders and administrators, as reduced interpersonal attachments have known associations with decreased mental health. In an effort to facilitate student well-being during the pandemic, the Virtual Wellness and Learning Communities (VWLC) program was established. VWLC consisted of hour-long events that offered students the opportunity to engage with their peers online.</p><p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:p1="http://pubmed.gov/pub-one">METHODS: More than 20 events and workshops were conducted from March to June 2020, including trivia nights, song and guitar performances, sketching, video editing tutorials, chess lessons, yoga, and personal investing tips. An institutional review board-approved survey to assess the efficacy of the VWLC program was sent to medical student participants and nonparticipants.</p><p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:p1="http://pubmed.gov/pub-one">RESULTS: The overall response rate of this study was 43% (53/123).

Of all of the respondents, 85% (45/53) reported a decreased sense of connectivity with peers because of the pandemic, and 40% (21/53) reported a decrease in their sense of wellness. After attending a VWLC event, 79% (26/33) reported an increased sense of peer connectivity, 61% (20/33) reported improved wellness, and 55% (18/33) believed that these events should continue postpandemic to supplement in-person programming.

For that, a sample of 717 participants, recruited through social media, were randomly assigned to listen to negative or positive news about COVID-19. After that, both groups were guided through a short relaxation pause. Their emotional state was measured before they listened to the audios and after each audio. Mixed linear models were used to evaluate the effects of news group, relaxation pause, mental health and well-being practices. Negative news worsened their emotional state, whereas positive news improved it. A brief relaxation pause improved the effects of negative news content and may mitigate the effects of this valence of information. Practicing physical activity, meditation/yoga was associated with better emotional responses.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34697586/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">34697586</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8529560/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8529560</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2021.100472>10.1016/j.invent.2021.100472</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

The objective of this review is to analyze the effectiveness of mind-body modalities for the mental health of HCWs in the COVID-19 era. Six electronic bibliographic databases were comprehensively searched to find intervention studies using mind-body modalities, including meditation, mindfulness-based intervention, autogenic training, yoga, tai chi, qigong, breathing exercise, music therapy, guided imagery, biofeedback, prayer, and faith-based techniques for HCWs. All intervention studies conducted from December 2019 to August 2021 will be included. Quality assessment will be performed according to study type, and Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool will be used for randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs). If sufficient homogeneous data from RCTs exist, a meta-analysis will be performed. Dichotomous data and continuous data are presented as risk ratios and mean differences with their 95% confidence intervals, respectively. The results of this systematic review will be disseminated through the publication of a manuscript in a peer-reviewed journal or by presentation at a conference.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34683000/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">34683000</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8544439/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8544439</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9101320>10.3390/healthcare9101320</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the prior outbreaks, fear of being infected was reported as the prominent suicide stressor. Therefore, fear of infection has become a concern in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic because it worsens emotion, cognition, and behavioral responses. Understanding the extent of fear of COVID-19 infection in various cohorts would aid in gauging the mental health services, which was a remedy in the present review. <b>Methods:</b> Adhering to Arksey and O'Malley's framework for conducting a scoping review, a systematic search was performed in the month of September 2020 in several databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, etc. Considering the inclusion criteria, a total of 14 articles were included in the present review. <b>Results:</b> All of the included studies were conducted via online platforms, whereas all but one of the studies were cross-sectional in nature (including a mixed-method study, and a comparative study). Most of the studies were conducted among the general population (<i>n</i> = 12), within March and May 2020 (<i>n</i> = 9), from Asian countries (<i>n</i> = 7), and considered a self-developed item for fear of COVID-19 assessment (<i>n</i> = 8; whereas the Fear of COVID-19 Scale was used in 6-studies). The prevalence of fear of COVID-19 was reported to be 18.1-45.2%, although no cutoff point or criteria was mentioned for such a prevalence estimation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. However, females, younger adults, urban residents, divorcees, healthcare workers, those in quarantine settings, those in suspicion of being infected, and those with mental health problems, etc., were found to be at an increased risk of COVID-19 fear. <b>Conclusions:</b> Being one of the first reviews in this context, the findings are anticipated to be helpful to predict the possible solutions for reducing fear of COVID-19 and facilitate further studies on strategies of how to alleviate such a stressful situation.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34557117/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">34557117</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8453018/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8453018</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.708430>10.3389/fpsyt.2021.708430</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

Consequently, realist evaluation is increasingly conducted in parallel with intervention trials. It comprises a clear philosophical foundation and view of causality, pragmatic mixed data collection methods, and a theory-driven approach in which hypothesised program theories are tested and refined. However, detailed methods for data analysis are seldom well-described in realist studies and no clear method for analysing and presenting realist evaluation data has yet emerged. In this methodological paper we use the worked example of our realist process evaluation of the SAGE yoga trial to illustrate an applied process of data analysis and presentation of findings. We show how we drew on other realist studies for ideas, provide examples of six key tasks involved in conducting a realist process evaluation (including coding data and structuring results) and describe strategies that did not work and our rationale for rejecting them. This detailed account of the decisions and methods that worked for us is intended to provide a practical and informed point of departure for researchers conducting a realist evaluation.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34501654/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">34501654</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8431647/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8431647</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179065>10.3390/ijerph18179065</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whilst physical exercise is known for its positive effect on enhancing immunity and reducing the negative consequences of unhealthy emotional states caused by the pandemic; there is a severe lack of psychological exercise intervention measures and mitigation strategies to advance the knowledge and role of physical exercise to improve mental health in most countries. This study surveyed the association between physical exercise and mental health burden during the COVID-19 outbreak in China to better understand the influence of different physical exercise types on reducing mental health burden during the pandemic. ANOVA, binary logistic regression, the chi-square test, and Spearman's correlation analysis were used for statistical analysis. 14,715 participants were included. The results showed that Chinese residents had several poor mental health conditions during the COVID-19 outbreak. And there was a significant positive correlation between the extent of adverse effects on mental health and provincial proportions of confirmed COVID-19 cases (r = 0.365, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Some main factors caused an unhealthy psychological status, including epidemic severity (62.77%, 95% CI 58.62-65.64%), prolonged home quarantine (60.84%, 95% CI 58.15-63.25%), spread of large amounts of negative information about COVID-19 in the media (50.78%, 95% CI 47.46-53.15%), limitations in daily life and social interaction (45.93%, 95%CI 42.46-47.55%), concerns about students' learning (43.13%, 95% CI 40.26-45.48%), and worries about being infected (41.13%, 95% CI 39.16-45.23%). There was a significant association between physical exercise and mental health. The largest associations were seen for home-based group entertainment exercise (i.e., family games, rope skipping, and badminton), Chinese traditional sports (i.e., Chinese martial arts, Taijiquan and Qigong), and popular sports (i.e., yoga, video dancing, sensory-motor games, and whole-body vibration), as well as durations of 30-60 min per session, frequencies of three to five times per week and a total of 120-270 min of moderate-intensity exercise weekly during the COVID-19 outbreak (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34489763/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">34489763</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8418057/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8418057</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.722448>10.3389/fpsyt.2021.722448</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

Although yoga continues to gain popularity among practitioners and researchers, pilot studies that examine its feasibility and acceptability, especially among cancer survivors, are limited. Feasibility studies play a critical role in determining whether the target population is likely to engage with larger scale efficacy and effectiveness trials. In this paper we present feasibility and acceptability data from a 12-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted with adult cancer survivors.</p><p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:p1="http://pubmed.gov/pub-one">METHODS: Participants n = 78 (Mean age: 55 years) were randomized to one of three groups: a Hatha yoga, aerobic exercise, or stretching-toning control group with group exercise classes held for 150 min/week for 12 weeks. Herein we report feasibility and acceptability, including enrollment rates, attendance, attrition and adverse events, and participant feedback and satisfaction data.</p><p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:p1="http://pubmed.gov/pub-one">RESULTS: Of the 233 adults screened, 109 were eligible and 78 randomized to one of the three intervention arms. Session attendance was high for all groups (75.5-89.5%) and 17 participants dropped out during the 12-week intervention. Program satisfaction was high (4.8 or higher out of 5) and no adverse events were reported. One cohort (n = 15) of the intervention transitioned to remote intervention delivery due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Feasibility data from these participants suggested that synchronized group exercise classes via Zoom with a live instructor were acceptable and enjoyable. Participant feedback regarding most and least helpful aspects of the program as well as suggestions for future yoga interventions are summarized.</p><p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:p1="http://pubmed.gov/pub-one">CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the yoga intervention was highly feasible and acceptable.

Methods An online cross-sectional survey was conducted in May-June, 2021 via Google Forms, which included adult individuals who were willing to participate in the study. The purposive and snowball sampling technique was used to ensure the principle of maximum diversity. Standardised tools [Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Impact of Event-Revised (IES-R), Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS), and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS)] were used to collect data. Results A total of 1,109 responses were analysed for this study. Participants of different age groups (mean age: 32.98 Â±14.72 years) and different sociodemographics were enrolled. The younger population group (18-34 years) was found to be the most affected among all the age groups. The findings revealed that 44.18% showed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-like symptoms. About 48.87%, 65.56%, and 22.09% of the participants had significant depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms respectively, and 11.27% had disturbed sleep patterns. Mental well-being was found to be disturbed for 74.75% of the study population, out of which only 4.15% showed high resilience capacity. Conclusion The associated collective psychological trauma mapped out by this paper is a pandemic in itself and needs to be addressed on a scale similar to the efforts being made to curb the physical symptoms of COVID-19.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34414046/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">34414046</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8364738/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8364738</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16420>10.7759/cureus.16420</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

Mitochondrial fission, fusion, and membrane potential play a central role in maintaining mitochondrial dynamics and the overall shape of mitochondria. Viruses change the dynamics of the mitochondria by altering the mitochondrial processes/functions, such as autophagy, mitophagy, and enzymes involved in metabolism. In addition, viruses decrease the supply of energy to the mitochondria in the form of ATP, causing viruses to create cellular stress by generating ROS in mitochondria to instigate viral proliferation, a process which causes both intra- and extra-mitochondrial damage. SARS-COV2 propagates through altering or changing various pathways, such as autophagy, UPR stress, MPTP and NLRP3 inflammasome. Thus, these pathways act as potential targets for viruses to facilitate their proliferation. Autophagy plays an essential role in SARS-COV2-mediated COVID-19 and modulates autophagy by using various drugs that act on potential targets of the virus to inhibit and treat viral infection. Modulated autophagy inhibits coronavirus replication; thus, it becomes a promising target for anti-coronaviral therapy. This review gives immense knowledge about the infections, mitochondrial modulations, and therapeutic targets of viruses.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34360945/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">34360945</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8347486/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8347486</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22158180>10.3390/ijms22158180</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

The current health care strategies have primarily focused on either the pathogen on the environmental factors. However, efforts towards strengthening the host immunity are important from public health perspective to prevent the spread of infection and downregulate the potency of the agent. While a vaccine can induce specific immunity in the host, non-specific ways of improving overall host immunity are the need. This scenario has paved the way for the use of traditional Indian therapies such as Ayurveda and Yoga. This review aims at collating available evidence on Ayurveda, Yoga and COVID-19. Further, it draws inferences from recent studies on Yoga and Ayurveda on immunity, respiratory health and mental health respectively to approximate its probable role in prophylaxis and as an add-on management option for the current pandemic.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34305355/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">34305355</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8286865/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8286865</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2021.07.009>10.1016/j.jaim.2021.07.009</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India, has permitted use of traditional systems of medicine for treating mild to moderate cases of COVID-19. In line with this, there are few case reports which reported promising results for treatment of COVID-19 with Ayurveda. These treatment reports highlighted subdued COVID-19 infections without developing serious complications. The present case is of a young hypertensive female patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19. Ayurvedic assessment for this was Kaphavataj jwara. The patient sought Ayurvedic treatment. She was advised the treatment module including medicines, diet and behavioral interventions. Though patient was having comorbid hypertension with major COVID-19 symptoms, she recovered with exclusive Ayurvedic treatment both physically as well as psychologically with no post COVID-19 complications till date. Ayurvedic treatment module appears to be safe and efficacious with early recovery and better outcomes.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34276164/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">34276164</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8277552/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8277552</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2021.07.005>10.1016/j.jaim.2021.07.005</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is a retrospective case series from among the initial 247 COVID-19 patients out of whom 39% were found to be suffering from co-morbidities. We have chosen seven of these patients who fulfilled the criteria for high-risk category, represented by multiple co-morbidities that included cancer, chronic kidney disease (CKD), coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and an elderly person over the age of 90 years. Classical Ayurvedic formulations for COVID -19 were chosen so as to avoid complicating co-morbid conditions and patients were maintained on a modified diet. All these high-risk patients were treated at an out-patient setting. The patients were under home quarantine and self-monitored their progress with daily follow-up over the phone by the treating Ayurvedic physician. The main outcome measure included resolution of symptoms and complete recovery from COVID-19 disease in all patients. This case series demonstrates the scope of Ayurvedic interventions in the management of high-risk COVID-19 patients with severe co-morbidities with successful outcome in an out-patient setting.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34276163/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">34276163</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8277097/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8277097</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2021.06.006>10.1016/j.jaim.2021.06.006</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

During the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health issues have grown increasingly more prevalent in the population. Due to social distancing and other limitations during the pandemic, there is a need for home-based, flexible interventions that can improve mental health. The Yoga of Immortals (YOI) mobile application provides a structured intervention that can be used on any mobile device and applied from the user's home. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 1,505 participants were enrolled in the study and used the YOI app for an 8-week period. Participants were asked to fill out three questionnaires: The Patient Health Questionnaire, 8 items (PHQ-8), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). These three items were completed by 1,297 participants a total of four times: before starting YOI, two more times during use, and a fourth time after the 8-week usage period. Changes in PHQ8, GAD7 and ISI in participants were compared to a control group, who did not use the YOI app but completed all questionnaires (590 controls finished all questionnaires). <b>Results:</b> Participants reported significant decreases in depression and anxiety-related symptoms. Compared to baseline, PHQ-8 scores decreased 50% on average after the 8-week period. GAD-7 scores also decreased by 40-50% on average, and ISI scores decreased by 50%. These changes were significantly greater (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) than that observed in the control group. Participants who reported a previous diagnosis of depression and generalized anxiety reported significantly larger decreases in PHQ-8 and GAD-7 as compared to participants with no prior diagnosis (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> Regular use of the YOI intervention over an 8-week period led to significant decreases in symptoms of both depression and anxiety, as well as alleviation of insomnia.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34239460/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">34239460</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8257949/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8257949</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.648029>10.3389/fpsyt.2021.648029</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

Yoga is a known practice that reduces stress and anxiety and may enhance immunity. This study aimed to (1) investigate that including Yoga in daily routine is beneficial for physical and mental health, and (2) to evaluate lifestyle of Yoga practitioners that may be instrumental in coping with stress associated with lockdown. This is a pan-India cross-sectional survey study, which was conducted during the lockdown. A self-rated scale, COVID Health Assessment Scale (CHAS), was designed by 11 experts in 3 Delphi rounds (Content valid ratio = 0.85) to evaluate the physical health, mental health, lifestyle, and coping skills of the individuals. The survey was made available digitally using Google forms and collected 23,760 CHAS responses. There were 23,290 valid responses (98%). After the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria of yogic practices, the respondents were categorized into the Yoga (<i>n</i> = 9,840) and Non-Yoga (<i>n</i> = 3,377) groups, who actively practiced Yoga during the lockdown in India. The statistical analyses were performed running logistic and multinomial regression and calculating odds ratio estimation using R software version 4.0.0. The non-Yoga group was more likely to use substances and unhealthy food and less likely to have good quality sleep. Yoga practitioners reported good physical ability and endurance. Yoga group also showed less anxiety, stress, fear, and having better coping strategies than the non-Yoga group. The Yoga group displayed striking and superior ability to cope with stress and anxiety associated with lockdown and COVID-19. In the Yoga group, participants performing meditation reportedly had relatively better mental health. Yoga may lead to risk reduction of COVID-19 by decreasing stress and improving immunity if specific yoga protocols are implemented through a global public health initiative.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34239456/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">34239456</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8257944/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8257944</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.613762>10.3389/fpsyt.2021.613762</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

The mainstream medical system is being handicapped with the challenge of patient management with no proven treatment at one end and the use of vaccine at the other with prevailing ambiguity in developing herd immunity and safety concerns of mass vaccinations amidst pandemic. Though vaccination is the only hope, fool proof evidences are absent on its efficacy. Also, adults of above 65 are of greater risk in terms of complications and death. China has already documented the use of traditional Chinese medicine against the pandemic with national participation rate of 90%. In this regard, the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) against COVID-19 is relevant, especially in a country like India where it is widely practised as Ayurveda.</p><p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:p1="http://pubmed.gov/pub-one">EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: The current report is a retrospective case series of 64 Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) above the age of 60 years tested positive through Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) through a Non-Linear multi-modal Ayurveda Intervention (NLMAI) for 21 days consulted through online media.

The objective of the overview was to summarise the evidence from different systematic reviews of distinct yoga interventions used to improve mental health and recommend yoga practices for the same. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020185221). MEDLINE via Pubmed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Google Scholar were searched for relevant literature. Search terms used were "Yoga practice, mental health and systematic review". Reviews from earliest possible date till May 2020, including those examining the effects of any single or combination of yoga interventions on mental health reported on children, youth and adults were selected. The Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool was used to evaluate the evidence of the included reviews. Out of the 90 reviews found, eight unique reviews were selected for the overview. Overall, 243 studies were analyzed, with an overlap of only 6 studies across the reviews. Out of 8 reviews, only 2 were of high quality and the rest were of moderate quality. Owing to heterogeneity of the included studies, only descriptive analysis was possible. The results of the review indicate moderate to positive effects of yoga on the mental health parameters. Practicing yoga (physical postures, Bhramary Pranayam, mindfulness meditation, sahaj yoga and laughter therapy) can be beneficial to improve psychological health of the people during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34172388/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">34172388</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8635286/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8635286</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2021.04.003>10.1016/j.jaim.2021.04.003</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

It covers a nanotechnology-based treatment approach and emphasizes the importance of herbal and marine antiviral drugs. The review attempts to explain current advances in research, prevention, and control of COVID-19 spread through artificial intelligence and vaccine development status under cosmopolitan consideration.<b>Expert opinion:</b> While COVID-19 research is advancing at full capacity, the discovery of drugs or vaccines that can fight the pandemic is necessary. Human survival in such a critical situation will be possible only with the development of strong immunity by opting for exercise, yoga, and consumption of hygienic food and beverages. Therefore, education about COVID-19 lethality and its impact on livelihood is important. The pandemic has also shown positive effects on the environment, such as a significant reduction in environmental pollution and global warming and improvement in river water quality.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34151679/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">34151679</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2021.1944103>10.1080/14787210.2021.1944103</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

In addition, social distancing, travel restrictions, and spread of disease have resulted in unique challenges, creating barriers to healthcare access. Compared to the rate prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant increase in clinical insomnia rates have been reported. With well-known limitations of currently established treatments (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy-insomnia (CBT-I), pharmacotherapy), there is a need to explore other effective and safe treatment modalities to treat insomnia, especially those that can be used remotely. The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of app-based intervention to treat insomnia in the current era of the COVID-19 pandemic (using the Yoga of Immortals (YOI) app). This prospective cohort study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. All participants in this study were asked to complete an online survey including demographic data and validated Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) at baseline (15 May 2020), 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after starting the YOI intervention. Survey data was exported using Microsoft Excel. Statistical analysis was done using the GraphPad Prism 8. YOI intervention significantly improved the mean ISI scores in all categories of insomnia (severe, moderate, and subthreshold) at each follow-up (<i>p</i> â‰¤ 0.0001). The improvement was significant among all age groups and in both genders. In our study, YOI was a novel and effective intervention for improving insomnia symptoms and may be a new addition to the armamentarium of insomnia management. Being app-based, this has potential wider applicability, especially during the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34073407/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">34073407</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8199123/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8199123</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18115706>10.3390/ijerph18115706</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

For its containment, measures such as isolation and quarantine are followed. The patients tested positive for COVID-19 disease are kept in isolation with no interaction with the family members leading to negative mental health consequences. To address this, Parul Sevashram Hospital adapted to a more holistic approach to treatment.</p><p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:p1="http://pubmed.gov/pub-one">METHODOLOGY: A process documentation of the best practices was undertaken.

      <title>Videoconferenced Yoga Interventions for Cancer Patients and their Caregivers during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Report from a Clinician's Perspective</title>
      <link>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34036820/?utm_source=Chrome&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&amp;fc=20210911080348&amp;ff=20220123062855&amp;v=2.17.5</link>
      <description>CONCLUSION: Although in-person interventions are favored by both the study participants and the interventionists, videoconference sessions were deemed acceptable. All participants had the benefit of a previous in-person experience, which was helpful and perhaps necessary for older and advanced cancer patients requiring practice modifications. In a remote setting, the assistance of caregivers seems particularly beneficial to ensure practice safety.</description>

Present case series is a same novel experience of early diagnosing and treating mid aged, morbid individuals who took only Ayurvedic treatment and could get out of the disease without any complications. This case series had 10 mid aged, morbid patients with maximum symptoms of COVID-19 disease and their hemogram and CRP was suggestive of moderate to severe type COVID-19/FLI/SARI. They were diagnosed by contemporary methods of pathology and treated with Ayurvedic classical medicines Tamra Sinduradi Yoga and Bhunimbadi Kwath for 20 days along with continuing the medicines for their ongoing morbidities. All 10 patients showed recoveries without any complications, they reduced their all symptoms, drastic reduction in their CRP and corrections in their hemograms were observed and also they showed any complications neither physically nor in their pathological tests. Hence it can be concluded that early diagnosis and treating it with Ayurvedic medicine can manage viral pandemic issue in a very successful way.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34024691/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">34024691</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8136275/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8136275</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2021.03.002>10.1016/j.jaim.2021.03.002</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

In addition, advances in digital technologies provide new opportunities to address limitations of drug-based treatments, such as medication non-adherence, adverse effects, toxicity, drug resistance, drug shortages, affordability, and accessibility. Pharmaceutical drugs and biologics can be combined with digital health technologies, including mobile medical apps (digital therapeutics), which offer additional clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness. Promises of drug+digital combination therapies are recognized by pharmaceutical and digital health companies, opening opportunities for integrating pharmacotherapies with non-pharmacological interventions (metapharmacology). Herein we present unique features of digital health technologies which can deliver personalized self-care modalities such as breathing exercises, mindfulness meditation, yoga, physical activity, adequate sleep, listening to preferred music, forgiveness and gratitude. Clinical studies reveal how aforementioned complimentary practices may support treatments of epilepsy, chronic pain, depression, cancer, and other chronic diseases. This article also describes how digital therapies delivering "medicinal" self-care and other non-pharmacological interventions can also be personalized by accounting for: 1) genetic risks for comorbidities, 2) adverse childhood experiences, 3) increased risks for viral infections such as seasonal influenza, or COVID-19, and 4) just-in-time stressful and traumatic circumstances. Development and implementation of personalized pharmacological-behavioral combination therapies (precision metapharmacology) require aligning priorities of key stakeholders including patients, research communities, healthcare industry, regulatory and funding agencies. In conclusion, digital technologies enable integration of pharmacotherapies with self-care, lifestyle interventions and patient empowerment, while concurrently advancing patient-centered care, integrative medicine and digital health ecosystems.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33972825/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">33972825</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8105510/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8105510</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.612602>10.3389/fphar.2021.612602</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

A subset of student musicians at a Higher Conservatory of Music in Spain followed the CRAFT program during the academic year 2019/2020, 1 h per week as part of their curriculum. Students enrolled in CRAFT-based elective subjects formed the CRAFT program group (<i>n</i> = 40), while other students represented the control group (<i>n</i> = 53). The onset of the national lockdown elicited by the COVID-19 pandemic occurred halfway through the program, which was subsequently delivered in an online format. We administered an online survey to explore the effect that the exposure to the CRAFT program had in terms of how participants dealt with various health and well-being concerns arising from the COVID-19 lockdown. There was a significantly higher proportion of proactive participants in the CRAFT program group, 92%, than in the control group, 58%, in terms of implementing practices to improve their health and well-being during the lockdown. Additionally, significantly more participants acknowledged perceived benefits from their practices in the CRAFT program group, 78%, than in the control group, 52%. Among proactive participants, yoga/meditation was the most implemented in the CRAFT program group, followed by exercise, and other yoga/meditation practices, whereas in the control group, exercise and Alexander technique-based practices were the most applied. In the CRAFT program group, the highest rate of perceived benefits was from yoga/meditation CRAFT-based practices, 51%, followed by exercise, 32%, and other yoga/meditation practices, 27%, whereas in the control group, benefits were reported by 29% of exercising participants and 16% for those having practiced the Alexander technique. A similar pattern was observed when excluding participants with previous yoga/meditation experience. This study revealed how participants can independently apply learned skills from the CRAFT program in response to a naturally occurring life event of unprecedented global impact, suggesting that previous exposure to mindfulness and yoga is likely to have a beneficial effect on how young adults react towards exceptionally stressful conditions.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33967904/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">33967904</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8097029/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8097029</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.642992>10.3389/fpsyg.2021.642992</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>CONCLUSIONS: The overall consistent positive influence of increased interpersonal relationships on health perceptions and adopted lifestyle behaviors during the pandemic is the key real-time finding of the survey. Favorable behavioral changes should be bolstered through regular virtual interpersonal interactions, particularly in countries with an overall middle-aged or older population.

The settings were China, Japan, Italy, and India. There were two primary outcomes: (1) response to the health scale, defined as perceived health status, a combined score of health-related survey items; and (2) adoption of healthy lifestyle choices, defined as the engagement of the respondent in any two of three healthy lifestyle choices (healthy eating habits, engagement in physical activity or exercise, and reduced substance use). Statistical associations were assessed with linear and logistic regression analyses.</p><p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:p1="http://pubmed.gov/pub-one">RESULTS: We received 3371 responses; 1342 were from India (39.8%), 983 from China (29.2%), 669 from Italy (19.8%), and 377 (11.2%) from Japan. A differential countrywise response was observed toward perceived health status; the highest scores were obtained for Indian respondents (9.43, SD 2.43), and the lowest were obtained for Japanese respondents (6.81, SD 3.44). Similarly, countrywise differences in the magnitude of the influence of perceptions on health status were observed; perception of interpersonal relationships was most pronounced in the comparatively old Italian and Japanese respondents (Î²=.68 and .60, respectively), and the fear response was most pronounced in Chinese respondents (Î²=.71). Overall, 78.4% of the respondents adopted at least two healthy lifestyle choices amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike health status, the influence of perception of interpersonal relationships on the adoption of lifestyle choices was not unanimous, and it was absent in the Italian respondents (odds ratio 1.93, 95% CI 0.65-5.79). The influence of perceived health status was a significant predictor of lifestyle change across all the countries, most prominently by approximately 6-fold in China and Italy.</p><p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:p1="http://pubmed.gov/pub-one">CONCLUSIONS: The overall consistent positive influence of increased interpersonal relationships on health perceptions and adopted lifestyle behaviors during the pandemic is the key real-time finding of the survey.

Further, controlling the fear response of the public through counseling could also help improve health perceptions and lifestyle behavior. However, the observed human behavior needs to be viewed within the purview of cultural disparities, self-perceptions, demographic variances, and the influence of countrywise phase variations of the pandemic. The observations derived from a short lockdown period are preliminary, and real insight could only be obtained from a longer follow-up.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33900928/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">33900928</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8171386/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8171386</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.2196/23630>10.2196/23630</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

We propose that minimizing meat consumption should become an essential dietary shift in the post-COVID-19 era. To date, however, there is limited knowledge concerning suitable methods that could catalyze this change on a global scale. Meditation and Yoga are practical and easy to implement psychomodulatory strategies that can naturally trigger vegetarianism and related eating behaviors, lowering our reliance on animal meat. Decreasing dependence on animal meat reduces the need for animal markets and may substantially minimize the likelihood of spillover (passage of viruses from animal reservoirs into human populations). Global implementation of these strategies, in our opinion, can add to spiritual wisdom, compassion, and cooperative human behavior, thus reducing the encroachment of wild-life reserves and animal exploitation. The application of these ancient Indian approaches represents a novel and focused strategy toward curbing zoonotic pandemics.

Vaccinations are disease specific and moreover strain specific, so the protection provided is also specific and limited. Antiviral therapies are costly and require bulk production of drugs, hence globally there is an increased interest toward low-risk, cost-effective complementary alternative therapies, such as Yoga and Ayurveda to tackle the infectious pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is clinical evidence available on the potential complementary role of yogic practices in the management of noncommunicable and communicable diseases. Various online databases were searched for articles published between 2000 and 2020. Databases explored were Medline, EMBASE, Indian Citation Index, PsycINFO, Index Medicus for South-East Asia Region, and Google Scholar. All search results were screened, and articles related to keywords such as COVID-19, yoga therapy, and Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) were selected for data extraction. Quality of the studies included was evaluated on the basis of the construct validity, content validity, relevance, bias, credibility relating to information, and data sources. SKY is a unique yogic practice that includes specific sequential breathing techniques. It balances the autonomic nervous system and thus can alleviate anxiety, routine stress, depression, stress-related medical disorders, and posttraumatic stress. It potentiates natural host immune defenses that are essential to tackle a plethora of microbial infections. This narrative review article provides an overview of potential therapeutic benefits that SKY can offer to the population at large during this COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33840973/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">33840973</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8023437/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8023437</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.4103/ijoy.IJOY_102_20>10.4103/ijoy.IJOY_102_20</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>CONCLUSION: There is some evidence that physical activity may provide benefit for the physical health and psychological wellbeing of those who have been bereaved, including when the loss has happened at a young age. This review is timely, given the wide-scale national loss of life due to COVID-19 and extends knowledge in this area. More research is needed to explore the benefits of physical activity for those who have been bereaved. In particular, there is a need for well-designed interventions...</description>

Grief is a natural consequence. Many mental health concerns, which can be identified as grief outcomes (e.g. anxiety and depression) in those who have experienced a bereavement, can be improved through physical activity.

A milestone of the anthropocene is the emergence of a series of epidemics and pandemics often characterized by the transmission of a pathogen from animals to human in the past two decades. In particular, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has made a profound impact on emergency responding and policy-making in a public health crisis. Classical solutions for controlling the virus, such as travel restrictions, lockdowns, repurposed drugs and vaccines, are socially unpopular and medically limited by the fast mutation and adaptation of the virus. This is exacerbated by microbial resistance to therapeutic drugs and the slowness of vaccine development. In other words, microbial pathogens are somehow 'smarter' and faster than us, thus calling for more intelligent cures to combat future pandemics. Here, we compare therapeutics for COVID-19 such as synthetic drugs, vaccines, antibodies and phages. We present the strength and limitations of antibiotic and antiviral drugs, vaccines, and antibody-based therapeutics. We describe smarter, cheaper and preventive cures such as bacteriophages, food medicine using probiotics and prebiotics, sports, healthy diet, music, yoga, Tai Chi, dance, reading, knitting, cooking and outdoor activities. Some of these preventive cures have been intuitively developed since thousands of years ago, as illustrated by the fascinating similarity of the Chinese characters for 'music' and 'herbal medicine.'</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33824633/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">33824633</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8017513/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8017513</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10311-021-01224-9>10.1007/s10311-021-01224-9</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

In tandem with the global scenario, researchers in India are actively engaged in the conduct of clinical research to counter the pandemic. This review attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 research in India including design aspects, through the clinical trials registered in the Clinical Trials Registry - India (CTRI) till June 5, 2020. One hundred and twenty two registered trials on COVID-19 were extracted from the CTRI database. These trials were categorized into modern medicine (n=42), traditional medicine (n=67) and miscellaneous (n=13). Of the 42 modern medicine trials, 28 were on repurposed drugs, used singly (n=24) or in combination (n=4). Of these 28 trials, 23 were to evaluate their therapeutic efficacy in different severities of the disease. There were nine registered trials on cell- and plasma-based therapies, two phytopharmaceutical trials and three vaccine trials. The traditional medicine trials category majorly comprised Ayurveda (n=45), followed by homeopathy (n=14) and others (n=8) from Yoga, Siddha and Unani. Among the traditional medicine category, 31 trials were prophylactic and 36 were therapeutic, mostly conducted on asymptomatic or mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients. This review would showcase the research being conducted on COVID-19 in the country and highlight the research gaps to steer further studies.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33818466/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">33818466</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC8184082/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC8184082</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_2556_20>10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_2556_20</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

This research examined the feasibility, acceptability and outcomes of delivering a 6-week yoga-based meditation intervention to clinical teams of hospice professionals (HPs) at a large non-profit hospice organization. The intervention was designed to increase mind-body integration and combat burnout. This article was written for different audiences, including research scientists who study interoception, burnout, meditation, or yoga, designers of meditation interventions, and hospice organizations looking for ways to mitigate HP burnout. (2) Methods. The intervention was launched within clinical teams, beginning with a half-hour online introduction to the program and exposure to the week 1 meditation at each team's monthly all-staff meeting. Throughout the program, HPs could access the meditations on their own via their workplace computers, tablets, and smartphones. Online pre- and post-intervention surveys were submitted by 151 HPs, 76 of whom were exposed to the intervention and completed both surveys. The surveys assessed burnout using the Professional Fulfillment Index and mind-body integration using the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness scales. (3) Results. Two-thirds of HPs who were present at a staff meeting where the program was introduced went on to do a meditation on their own at least once. Half of HPs expressed a desire to continue with access to the meditations after the 6-week program ended. Due to COVID-19 work from home restrictions, three-fourth of HPs did a meditation at home, 29% in a car between patient visits (not while driving), and 23% at the office. Higher interoceptive awareness was significantly related to lower burnout, particularly lower work exhaustion. Meditation frequency was significantly related to higher interoceptive awareness but not to burnout. Interpersonal disengagement was rare and temporary. (4) Conclusions. Findings showed that the yoga-based meditation intervention was feasible and acceptable and associated with higher interoceptive awareness. The results point to a role for interoceptive awareness in reducing the risk for burnout.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33802581/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">33802581</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7967352/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC7967352</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18052515>10.3390/ijerph18052515</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, little has been described about how National Cancer Institute-Designated Cancer Centers have transformed integrative oncology care delivery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this commentary is to describe the delivery of integrative oncology clinical services and conduct of research at The Leonard P. Zakim Center for Integrative Therapies and Healthy Living at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical services transitioned from an array of in-person appointment-based services, such as acupuncture and massage, and group programs, such as yoga and nutrition seminars to a combination of live-streamed and on-demand virtual group programs and one-on-one virtual appointments for services such as acupressure and self-care massage. Group program volume grew from 2189 in-person program patient visits in the 6 months prior to onset of the COVID pandemic to 16,366 virtual (e.g., live-streamed or on-demand) patient visits in the first 6 months of the pandemic. From a research perspective, two integrative oncology studies, focused on yoga and music therapy, respectively, were transitioned from in-person delivery to a virtual format. Participant accrual to these studies increased after the transition to virtual consent and intervention delivery. Overall, our clinical and research observations at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute suggest that the delivery of virtual integrative oncology treatments is feasible and appealing to patients.

Considerable amount of research is going on worldwide to find out effective drugs against the virus. Chloroquine phosphate, an antimalarial drug is currently used for the treatment. Studies on the harmful effects of chloroquine is in progress. India is rich in traditional medical practicing such as Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani etc. Ministry of AYUSH is trying to implement an interdisciplinary treatment encompassing all traditional methodologies. It is proven that Ashwagandha rasayana (<i>Withania sominefera L.Dunal</i>) has better functions than hydroxychloroquine. The ayurvedic formulations such as Sudarshan Ghanvati and Sanshamanivati are also used. The combination of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin is found to cure COVID-19 more effectively. Use of Tocilizumab is found to cure the respiratory disorders associated with COVID. Favilavir turns out to be yet another effective drug. The alternative medical system has effective prophylaxis and is considered better for the treatment of COVID-19. Ayurveda and yoga improve immunity thus maintaining good health. This review throws light on the mode of progression of the virus along with the various treatment protocols adopted to fight COVID-19.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33758747/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">33758747</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7972675/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC7972675</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2021.03.066>10.1016/j.matpr.2021.03.066</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

Ancient Hindu scriptures, notably the Bhagavad Gita, have a wealth of insights that can help approaches to build psychological resilience for individuals at risk, those affected, as well as for caregivers. The <i>path of knowledge</i> (Jnana yoga) promotes accurate awareness of nature of the self, and can help reframe our thinking from an "I" to a "we mode," much needed for collectively mitigating the spread of the coronavirus. The path of action (Karma yoga) teaches the art of selfless action, providing caregivers and frontline health-care providers a framework to continue efforts in the face of uncertain consequences. Finally, the path of meditation (Raja yoga) offers a multipronged approach to healthy lifestyle and mindful meditation, which may improve resilience to the illness and its severe consequences. While more work is needed to empirically examine the potential value of each of these approaches in modern psychotherapy, the principles herein may already help individuals facing and providing care for the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33678824/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">33678824</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7909017/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC7909017</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.4103/psychiatry.IndianJPsychiatry_829_20>10.4103/psychiatry.IndianJPsychiatry_829_20</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

An ample number of clinical trials with multiple drugs is underway to overcome the current perilous condition. Still, the situation is alarming with no therapeutic measure in our hand at present. Keeping the present scenario in mind, this review comprises the research, clinical knowledge, and repurposed herbals with regard to COVID-19. Preventive measures such as yoga, nasal breathing, and herbal administration could also provide protection and beneficial effects against coronavirus. Innumerable clinical trials are ongoing to manage COVID-19 and the drugs were selected on the basis of life cycle of coronavirus. The selection of herbals was done on the basis of the previous reported pharmacological activities and docking study. The results concluded that garlic, liquorice, and Ashwagandha have a potential against SARS-CoV-2, which was further proved via a docking study and their reported biological functions. The very well-known fact "prevention is always better than cure" is applied to overcome with coronavirus infection. It is expected that following the preventive measures could impede or lessen the adverse effect of SARS-CoV-2.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33639071/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">33639071</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1615/JEnvironPatholToxicolOncol.2020036207>10.1615/JEnvironPatholToxicolOncol.2020036207</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

It seems appropriate to examine and evaluate these efforts to support the mental health needs of learners, faculty, and staff as medicine and medical education evolve in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. To date, most interventions intended to promote well-being have focused on individual strategies rather than environmental drivers of distress, and the primary offerings have comprised strategies such as mindfulness, meditation, yoga, nutrition, exercise, and sleep. Responses to this programming from medical learners have primarily ranged from ambivalence to resentment, with many feeling that the programming failed to adequately address their particular needs and the challenges they were experiencing. In this commentary, the author challenges the assumption that well-being per se should be the ideal target or goal. Learners and faculty may be better served by considering other goals-those that do not focus directly on well-being but that are instead foundational for well-being in that they directly address the challenges that students, residents, and faculty are facing. In other words, goals and associated interventions would focus on the experience of school and work rather than focusing primarily on encouraging healthy practices outside of school and work. The author proposes using the lens of satisfaction through which to view and assess progress toward well-being, increasing satisfaction within 3 interconnected domains: (1) school and/or work, (2) self, and (3) life in general. Attention to these domains may be more likely to produce improvements in well-being that have been sought for years but that remain elusive.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33635840/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">33635840</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000004023>10.1097/ACM.0000000000004023</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

These challenges are felt more keenly in India, as they stretch an insufficiently resourced healthcare system. The long hours, cross over of responsibilities, lack of resources to adequately care for patients, and concerns around safety of self and loves ones, have led to a spike in anxiety, depression, insomnia and other stress - related disorders in healthcare providers. Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) is a mind-body intervention that has been studied in multiple clinical populations. Prior to this study, there has been no exploration of the impact of SKY on healthcare providers, specifically the impact of a mind-body intervention like SKY on HCPs during a pandemic.</p><p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:p1="http://pubmed.gov/pub-one">OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the impact of SKY on the well-being of HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:p1="http://pubmed.gov/pub-one">METHODS: We conducted a pilot feasibility study with a single arm pre-post design.

The participants were grouped as; yoga practitioners, other spiritual practitioners, and non-practitioners based on their responses to daily practices that they follow. Yoga practitioners were further examined based on the duration of practice as; long-term, mid-term and beginners. Multivariate analysis indicates that yoga practitioners had significantly lower depression, anxiety, &amp; stress (DASS), and higher general wellbeing (SWGB) as well as higher peace of mind (POMS) than the other two groups. The results further revealed that the yoga practitioners significantly differed in the perception of personal control, illness concern and emotional impact of COVID19. However, there was no significant difference found for the measure of resilience (BRS) in this study. Yoga practitioners also significantly differed in the cognitive reappraisal strategy for regulating their emotions than the other two groups. Interestingly, it was found that beginners -those who had started practicing yoga only during the lockdown period reported no significant difference for general wellbeing and peace of mind when compared to the mid- term practitioner. Evidence supports that yoga was found as an effective self- management strategy to cope with stress, anxiety and depression, and maintain wellbeing during COVID19 lockdown.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33566848/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">33566848</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7875402/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC7875402</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245214>10.1371/journal.pone.0245214</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Scientific research in integrative medicine has undergone significant development in recent years. Several studies published in 2020 focus on the management of chronic pain.

Several studies published in 2020 focus on the management of chronic pain. Hypnosis has been shown to be as effective in analgesia as cognitive-behavioral therapy and therapeutic education. A study on chronic low back pain showed lower health care costs for patients using complementary medicine. Furthermore, the hypothesis of super responders to acupuncture treatment does not seem to be confirmed. Yoga could be a useful approach in the prevention of migraines. With respect to the management of COVID-19, the addition of traditional Chinese medicine to conventional treatments could reduce a number of symptoms and the length of hospital stays, although the quality of data is limited.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33507654/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">33507654</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, physical distancing between clinicians and patients with spine-related symptoms is not solely limited to restrictions imposed by pandemic-related lockdowns. In most low- and middle-income countries, as well as many underserved marginalized communities in high-income countries, there is little to no access to clinicians trained in evidence-based care for people experiencing spinal pain.</p><p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:p1="http://pubmed.gov/pub-one">OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe the development and present the components of evidence-based patient and clinician guides for the management of spinal disorders where in-person care is not available.</p><p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:p1="http://pubmed.gov/pub-one">METHODS: Ultimately, two sets of guides were developed (one for patients and one for clinicians) by extracting information from the published Global Spine Care Initiative (GSCI) papers. An international, interprofessional team of 29 participants from 10 countries on 4 continents participated. The team included practitioners in family medicine, neurology, physiatry, rheumatology, psychology, chiropractic, physical therapy, and yoga, as well as epidemiologists, research methodologists, and laypeople. The participants were invited to review, edit, and comment on the guides in an open iterative consensus process.</p><p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:p1="http://pubmed.gov/pub-one">RESULTS: The Patient Guide is a simple 2-step process. The first step describes the nature of the symptoms or concerns. The second step provides information that a patient can use when considering self-care, determining whether to contact a clinician, or considering seeking emergency care. The Clinician Guide is a 5-step process: (1) Obtain and document patient demographics, location of primary clinical symptoms, and psychosocial information. (2) Review the symptoms noted in the patient guide. (3) Determine the GSCI classification of the patient's spine-related complaints. (4) Ask additional questions to determine the GSCI subclassification of the symptom pattern. (5) Consider appropriate treatment interventions.</p><p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:p1="http://pubmed.gov/pub-one">CONCLUSIONS: The Patient and Clinician Guides are designed to be sufficiently clear to be useful to all patients and clinicians, irrespective of their location, education, professional qualifications, and experience. However, they are comprehensive enough to provide guidance on the management of all spine-related symptoms or disorders, including triage for serious and specific diseases. They are consistent with widely accepted evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. They also allow for adequate documentation and medical record keeping. These guides should be of value during periods of government-mandated physical or social distancing due to infectious diseases, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. They should also be of value in underserved communities in high-, middle-, and low-income countries where there is a dearth of accessible trained spine care clinicians. These guides have the potential to reduce the overutilization of unnecessary and expensive interventions while empowering patients to self-manage uncomplicated spinal pain with the assistance of their clinician, either through direct in-person consultation or via telehealth communication.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33471778/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">33471778</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7891494/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC7891494</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.2196/25484>10.2196/25484</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

To reduce the potential transmission, countries throughout the world practiced social distancing. Unfortunately, this social distancing often contributed to a sense of social isolation and physical inactivity. Two physician athletes on opposite coasts of the United States sought to change this narrative by promoting physical activity among the general population with the #SocialDistancingFitnessChallenge. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in March and April 2020, these physicians would post exercises during the 5-day workweek-one would post yoga/flexibility exercises, while the other would post high-intensity cardio and strength exercises on two social media platforms. Some posts would amass over 100,000 views. They received daily feedback on how this challenge not only encouraged others to be engaged in physical activity during the most challenging pandemic of our lifetimes, but it also improved their mental health and outlook on the future amid great uncertainty.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33467929/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">33467929</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839920988261>10.1177/1524839920988261</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of substance abuse in India and discuss the cost-effective public health strategies (such as yoga) to alleviate COVID-related anxiety in order to prevent substance abuse and its associated co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study reports the data on tobacco and alcohol abuse from a nationwide randomized two-arm diabetes control trial (Niyantrita Madhumeha Bharata, 2017) conducted by the Indian Yoga Association (IYA) through Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (S-VYASA), Bengaluru. Data of 30,354 participants who abuse tobacco and 30,159 participants who abuse alcohol were collected all over India. The prevalence is estimated at around 8.7% for alcohol abuse and 7.9% for tobacco abuse, Arunachal Pradesh state ranking the highest regarding both alcohol and tobacco abuse, while the Tripura state ranked the lowest. School and college-based mandatory yoga programs need to be implemented to prevent the increase of substance abuse in India to alleviate the psychosocial stress of adolescents and college-going students, besides the installation of the mindfulness-based diabetes yoga protocol (DYP) in the wellness centers of Ayushman Bharat.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33456598/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">33456598</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7803324/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC7803324</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.25122/jml-2020-0079>10.25122/jml-2020-0079</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

This study aimed to analyse the changes in physical activity and sedentary behaviours in Spanish university students before and during the confinement by COVID-19 with special focus on gender. We also analysed enjoyment, the tools used and motivation and impediments for doing physical activity. An online questionnaire, which included the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form and certain "ad hoc" questions, was designed. Students were recruited by distributing an invitation through the administrative channels of 16 universities and a total of 13,754 valid surveys were collected. Overall, university students reduced moderate (-29.5%) and vigorous (-18.3%) physical activity during the confinement and increased sedentary time (+52.7%). However, they spent more time on high intensity interval training (HIIT) (+18.2%) and mind-body activities (e.g., yoga) (+80.0%). Adaptation to the confinement, in terms of physical activity, was handled better by women than by men. These results will help design strategies for each gender to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour during confinement periods.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33418907/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">33418907</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7825050/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC7825050</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020369>10.3390/ijerph18020369</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

Participants self-reported past-month PA (meeting vs. not meeting guidelines), changes in stress (decreased/unchanged vs. increased) and use (yes/no) of 10 stress management strategies.

      <description>CONCLUSION: Relative to the control group, alternative exercise traditions may be effective in improving the quality of life, anxiety, depression, distress, and fatigue of cancer patients. However, they may not necessarily improve patients' sleep outcome, body mass index, and pain. During convalescence, cancer patients can be encouraged to start engaging in physical exercise, and professionals can develop appropriate exercise alternatives to ensure the expected effect of exercise while ensuring...</description>

Maternal mental health and well-being is a public health priority and the evidence about the impact of COVID-19 on mental health status of pregnant women is gradually emerging. The findings of the recently published studies suggest that increased risk perception about contracting COVID-19, reduced social support, increase in domestic violence, disruption of antenatal care, and economic consequences of COVID-19 mitigation strategies can lead to adverse mental health outcomes in antenatal period. There is a significant increase in antenatal depression and anxiety since the onset of COVID-19 and social determinants of health (e.g., younger age, lower education, lower income) are associated with these poor outcomes. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach to improve the mental health and well-being of pregnant women. Physical activity and/or mind-body interventions like yoga can be practiced as self-care interventions by pregnant women. Despite social distancing being the current norm, efforts should be made to strengthen social support. Evidence-based interventions for perinatal depression should be integrated within the health system and stepped, collaborative care using non-specialist health workers as key human resource be utilized to improve access to mental health services. Use of digital platforms and smartphone enabled delivery of services has huge potential to further improve the access to care. Most importantly, the COVID-19 related policy guidelines should categorically include maternal mental health and well-being as a priority area.</p><p style="color: lightgray">PMID:<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33329148/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">33329148</a> | PMC:<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC7732456/?utm_source=Chrome&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pubmed-2&utm_content=1lW0W_7uVpSKXMSoTDV8C5KOzThchN1W7OeYg6rBNIBG2i3QQf&fc=20210911080348&ff=20220123062855&v=2.17.5">PMC7732456</a> | DOI:<a href=https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.598746>10.3389/fpsyt.2020.598746</a></p></div>]]></content:encoded>
